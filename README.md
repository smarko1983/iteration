# Iterables and Iterators

This repository records the materials associated with a talk given at PyData London 2016.

The slides are available both in their original PowerPoint format and in PDF.

The supporting Jupyter notebook is available in a full annotated version as well as the
code-only form that was used interactively during the presentation.
The annotated version is also presented as an HTML file for those who have not yet
installed the Jupyter system.
